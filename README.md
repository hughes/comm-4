framework for everything 4
==========================

lately, whatever I work on, I keep making parts of the same program, this is an attempt to write it fully and win at programming.

its a graph structure of parsers of abstract messages. 
yes, sounds like actors and I should read up on them some more.

to be distributed it supports different transport protocols, things like retransmitions, automatic fallback for transport protocols, pattern matching, requrest/response middleware, and things like that. 

things implemented on top of this are:

automatic backbone model syncing between machines, 
automatic backbone model db syncing, 
http apis, 
a thing that locks my screen when laptop lid is closed 
or a thing that downloads torrents by looking at rss stream and lets me know about it over jabber
